The deprecated filtering service is facing deployment issues. New configuration deployments will not occur anymore, and traffic may face some instabilities until it’s fixed.

**If you urgently need to deploy configuration changes**, please redirect your DNS to the new platform as advised in previous communications. Information on how to proceed is available in the release note: https://documentation.ubikasec.com/waap-saas-en/2024-version-history.html#infrastructure-resilience-upgrade  
More generally, it’s strongly advised to switch to the new platform in any cases.
