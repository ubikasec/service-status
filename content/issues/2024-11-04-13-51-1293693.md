The deprecated filtering service is facing deployment issues. New configuration deployments will not occur anymore, and traffic may face some instabilities until it’s fixed. {{< track "2024-11-04 13:51:41" >}}  

**If you urgently need to deploy configuration changes**, please redirect your DNS to the new platform as advised in previous communications. Information on how to proceed is available in the release note: https://documentation.ubikasec.com/waap-saas-en/2024-version-history.html#infrastructure-resilience-upgrade  
More generally, it’s strongly advised to switch to the new platform in any cases.

Deployment issue is solved. An internal network was saturated, forbidding spawning of new containers. {{<track "2024-11-05 09:40:00" >}}
