We do not reproduce impact, but it seems that there are issues reported by customers that it has impact on traffic.

Gravelines cluster is now out of production to avoid side effects {{< track "2025-11-07T15:50:00+01:00" >}}

Our second cluster now exhibits the same behaviour. You may encounter 504 HTTP error in particular if WAF configurations are frequently reloaded.

We enabled back the Gravelines cluster as there is no benetif of keeping it off. Investigations are ongoing with our hoster. {{< track "2025-11-07T16:40:00+01:00" >}}
