Dear Customer, Dear Partner,

Some asset are facing traffic logs loss on our Gravelines cluster. Cause is under investigation.

This have no impact on filtering efficiency and traffic passing through Cloud Protector.

We do not reproduce impact, but it seems that there are issues reported by customers that it has impact on traffic.

Gravelines cluster is now out of production to avoid side effects {{< track "2025-11-07T15:50:00+01:00" >}}

Our second cluster now exhibits the same behaviour. You may encounter 504 HTTP error in particular if WAF configurations are frequently reloaded.

We enabled back the Gravelines cluster as there is no benefit of keeping it off. Investigations are ongoing with our hoster. {{< track "2025-11-07T16:40:00+01:00" >}}

If possible, avoid to update configurations of assets to avoid assets issues. We are on the process of applying a workaround that mitigate the issue.

Our hoster is investigating on the managed kubernetes infrastructures that seems to be the cause of the issue. {{< track "2025-11-07T18:10:00+01:00" >}}
