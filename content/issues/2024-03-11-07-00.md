* **Description:** Software Upgrade
* **When:** Expected Upgrade Start Date and Time: 11 March 2024 at 8:00am CET to 10:00am CET
* **Business Impact:** This duration defines the Maintenance Window only and does not reflect a downtime duration. Interruption should not last longer than 5 minutes.
* **Expected action(s) from customer:** None.

Our private cloud hoster OVHCloud will deploy an urgent upgrade on the network component of our cluster. Upgrade should be transparent and without interruption during the network router rollout. But we prefer to announce a potential interruption **that should not last longer than 5 minutes**.

You have nothing to do on your side. DNS records and IP addresses will remain unchanged. This upgrade will be completely transparent for you, besides the potential network interruption.

We apologize for the inconvenience caused by this upgrade. Please do not hesitate to contact our support team if you encounter any problems following this upgrade.
