Dear Customer, Dear Partner,

A DDoS attack is ongoing since Friday, 01/08/2025, starting at 13:20 PM CEST.

The service remains operational. For now, the impact is very low. The disruptions are barely visible to the most sensitive probes.
If the attack escalates, you can redirect your DNS to our new CNAME. You can find the CNAME in the asset configuration page.
