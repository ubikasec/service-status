Our monitoring probes reported instability in access to public IP addresses carrying application traffic.  
We also saw major disruptions in access to the Cloud Protector administration console.

Traffic continues to be processed, however, with an average latency of 30s.  
No abnormal traffic was observed, and application DDoS attacks were immediately ruled out.

We conclude that the cause is external to our infrastructure. Despite opening an incident with our service provider, we have been unable to obtain any clues as to the cause of the incident.
