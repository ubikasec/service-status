Our OVHCloud private cloud infrastructure hosting UBIKA Cloud Protector is currently using an edge network management component that reached end-of-life support. Thus we must migrate to the new infrastructure provided by our private cloud provider. We are now ready to launch this migration.  
During the migration, **a network interruption is expected when moving the routing of our IP addresses pool** to the target infrastructure. **This interruption should not last longer than 5 minutes**. During our tests, we observed an interruption between 2min and 2min30s.

You have nothing to do on your side. DNS records and IP addresses will remain unchanged. This migration will be completely transparent for you, besides the network interruption.

We apologize for the inconvenience caused by this migration. We are doing our utmost to minimize the impact of the interruption. Please do not hesitate to contact our support team if you encounter any problems following this migration.
