A performance problem is currently affecting the business log ingestion platform (traffic logs and security events).

Corrective maintenance is scheduled for November 14, 2024 from 8am CET.  
**No interruption of the filtering service is expected.**

No loss of logs is expected during the update. However, the history of business logs will be unavailable for 1 to 3 hours, while they are reimported asynchronously.

Database upgrade is finished. New logs are correctly processed. Reimport of history data will now be processed. {{<track "2024-11-14T08:33:00+01:00" >}}

Import is finished, all history data are available again. {{<track "2024-11-14T12:51:00+01:00" >}}
