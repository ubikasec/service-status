  Runtime cluster reports 100% CPU without significant network load. Investigation is going on.

- Our private cloud reports runtime hosts as dead, runtime cluster is not reacheable any more {{< track "2023-10-23 18:05:00" >}}.

  Team will investigate during working hour on why the cluster went 100% CPU without traffic to avoid this situtaition again.
