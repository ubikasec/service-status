Dear Customer, Dear Partner,

Our filtering cluster hosted in Gravelines faced troubles to deploy new configuration updates. Hence, we decided to isolate it from production.

Please note that **the service remains fully operational via our Strasbourg cluster**, ensuring continued protection and availability. In case of configuration modification, the deployment status in the console will remain in “pending” state (orange). This is a consequence of Gravelines isolation and has no impact on the service availibility.

A case is ongoing with our hosting provider.
