Dear Customer, Dear Partner,

A SYN Flood attack is ongoing since Tuesday, 04/02/2025, starting at 7:15 AM CET, targeting the load balancer upstream of the Cloud Protector infrastructure.
The service remain operational with a minor impact on the platform's response time. However, some probes turned red due to packet loss (without retries).

The SYN Flood attack ended at 7:15 AM CET.  
Investigations to explain the packet loss are still ongoing with our hoster.
