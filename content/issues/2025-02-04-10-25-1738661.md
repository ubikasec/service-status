Dear Customer, Dear Partner,

A SYN Flood attack occurre since Tuesday, 02/04/2025, starting at 7:15 AM, targeting the load balancer upstream of the Cloud Protector infrastructure.
The service remain operational with a minor impact on the platform's response time. However, some probes turned red due to packet loss (without retries).
