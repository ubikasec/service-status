Dear Customer, Dear Partner,

A SYN Flood attack occurred on Tuesday, 12/31/2024, starting at 7:00 AM, targeting the load balancer upstream of the Cloud Protector infrastructure.
The service remained operational with a minor impact on the platform's response time. However, some probes turned red due to packet loss (without retries).
The attack was moderate and ended on Wednesday, 01/01/2025, at 7:00 AM.
