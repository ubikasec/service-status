Dear Customer, Dear Partner,

A DDoS attack is ongoing since Wednesday, 02/07/2025, starting at 8:20 AM CEST.

The service remains operational. Clients may encounter sporadic packet loss during TLS handshake. Browser usually recover well for such network errors at the cost of a small delay. API clients that do not retry on TCP error and monitoring probes may return errors.

We are currently investigating on a working workaround to this typology of attacks.

Attack has reduced. We do not notice disruptions anymore. {{< track "2025-07-02T11:30:00+02:00" >}}

Further tests have been performed and shared with our OVHCloud taskforce to exclude various root causes of the perturbations. Conclusions will be shared later after further analysis.
