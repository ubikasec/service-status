Maintenance is scheduled for Thursday, November 2 at 5:30 a.m., and should last no longer than 1 hour.  
No interruptions are planned, maintenance should be totally transparent.

Maintenance was longer than expected:
* Instead of transparently migrating the compute cluster, we had to reconstruct it asside. Without interruption on running trafic.
* Once this reconstruction was finished, traffic was switched to the new compute cluster. Thus, active connections have been interrupted by the load balancer reconfiguration. Thus some end-user clients may have seen disruption and reconnect around 08:20.
