Dear Customer, Dear Partner,

A DDoS attack is ongoing since Thursday, 22/05/2025, starting at 8:20 AM CEST.

The service remains operationnal with minimal impact. We are currently investigating on the attack typology before applying a workaround planned in collaboration with our hoster OVHCloud to completely cut down the attack.
