Dear Customer, Dear Partner,

A DDoS attack is ongoing since Thursday, 22/05/2025, starting at 8:20 AM CEST.

The service remains operationnal with minimal impact. We are currently investigating on the attack typology before applying a workaround planned in collaboration with our hoster OVHCloud to completely cut down the attack.

Analyze is ongoing. The workaround has been applied by OVHCloud. Service should improve for those that are the most impacted (API consumers). {{< track "2025-05-22T10:21:00+02:00" >}}

Attack has ended. {{< track "2025-05-23T08:20:00+02:00" >}}

Network dumps have been captured before and after the workaround was applied by OVHCloud. Analyze will continue in collaboration with OVHCloud to understand the root cause of the sporadic packet loss and retransmission that was observed during the attack and address it.
