We kindly remind you that you need to **update your DNS records to get the resiliency benefits** from the last releases. Follow the direction that were provided in the previous communications. You can also get those instructions in the release note. Especially **be careful about your firewall rules before updating your DNS records**.

Information on how to proceed is available in the release note: https://documentation.ubikasec.com/waap-saas-en/2024-version-history.html#infrastructure-resilience-upgrade

**You are especially concerned if your protected assets are not anymore reported as “DNS redirected” in the console.**
