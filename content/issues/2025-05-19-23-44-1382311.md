A cluster of Cloud Protector Legacy applications (<80) are unavailable. {{< track "2025-05-19T23:44:52.058275168+02:00" >}}

One of the applications is under HTTP DDoS attack. The load balancer is unable to handle the load (~100 000 requests per second). {{< track "2025-05-20T00:00:00+02:00" >}}

Decision is taken to evict the targeted application on a separate cluster. {{< track "2025-05-20T00:20:00+02:00" >}}

The targeted application is now fully handled by the new cluster. End of the disruption for the applications that shared the same cluster. {{< track "2025-05-20T00:49:51.519302029+02:00" >}}
