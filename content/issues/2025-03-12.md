Dear Customer, Dear Partner,

A DDoS attack is ongoing since Wednesday, 12/03/2025, starting at 7:15 AM CET, targeting the load balancer upstream of the Cloud Protector infrastructure.

IMPACT:
* The service remain operational with a minor impact on the platform's response time for browser clients.
* However, probes and API clients may have issues contacting the service due to packet loss (without retries like web browser).
