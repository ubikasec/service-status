Dear Customer, Dear Partner,

A DDoS attack is ongoing since Wednesday, 12/03/2025, starting at 7:15 AM CET, targeting one of our customer.

IMPACT:
* The service remain operational with a minor impact on the platform's response time for browser clients.
* However, probes and API clients may have issues contacting the service due to packet loss (without aggressive retries like web browser).

Update {{<track "2025-03-12T11:00:00+01:00" >}}  

Attack is still ongoing, but at very low rate. Impact should be nearly invisible for every workload.  
We may have identified the source of the sporadic traffic loss, related to the attack typology. A fix will be deployed soon to address the issue.
