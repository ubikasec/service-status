Dear Customer, Dear Partner,

Following a production release on our filtering clusters this morning, we observed a temporary increase in latency between 10:30 AM and 11:30 AM.
The situation was fully resolved by 11:30 AM, and our teams have confirmed that all services are now stable.

This was an isolated and exceptional event.

Thank you for your understanding.
