Dear Customer, Dear Partner,

Our filtering cluster hosted in Gravelines is currently having Control Plane issue and does not deploy anymore configuration updates. We decided to remove it from our load balancing to avoid outdated configurations running.

A case is ongoing with our hoster. Service remains operational in Strasbourg cluster.
