A customer has been attacked. The load-balancer affected to this customer and some others had his queue overloaded. **IMPACT:** there is a slow-down to handle traffic. No interruption identified.

The customer has been evicted, but the attack did not follow the DNS change. The load balancer was tuned to handle the remaining load without impacting the legitimate traffic.
